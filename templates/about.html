<h1>Pig Latin Translator</h1>

If a word begins with a vowel, just as "yay" to the end.
<br/>
For example, "out" is translated into "outyay".
<br/>
If it begins with a consonant, then we take all consonants before the first vowel and we put them on the end of the word.
<br/>
For example, "which" is translated into "ichwhay".
